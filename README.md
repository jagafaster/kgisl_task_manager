# Task Manager App (MERN)

## Overview
Task Manager App is a simple MERN stack web application to manage daily tasks.  
It allows users to perform full CRUD operations:
- Add a task
- View all tasks
- Update a task
- Delete a task

No authentication is included as per the task requirement. The focus is purely on core functionality.
